# Preconditions

This dapp is based on the official tutorial of Truffle Framework: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop. So, I strongly recommend to read it before.

You need to pay attention to configure and run Ganache (for a local blockchain) and MetaMask (for a client web blockchain).
